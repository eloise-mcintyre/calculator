CSS
1. import font you want to use

2. assign all colours you want to use to a key you can remember.

3. make the width of the body 100% and assign it a background color

4. Give the calculator div a height and width, background colour, and margins + padding. 

5. curve all the edges of the calculator div

6. give the left and right side of the calculator div a slight shadow. 

7. align all the text in the calculator div center (this will only affect the title and tagline)

8. to the title id, give the div some padding and margin, and darken it's colour compared to the calculator. Give it the Pacifico font. 

9. to the tagline ID, uppercase the div, color it a light grey, give it the open sans font and reducde its font size slightly. 

10. To the number input box, give the text characteristics of a calculator by changing color, font size, the border of the box, the padding, and the line height. 

11. give the row class the display of block.

12. change the size of the buttons to fit within the calculator comfortably and give them each a border. 

13. add more to this later
